# Waste Thermo Energy Reactor 🔥⚡
Convert Waste Heat to Electricity using Thermoelectric Technology and AI/ML-based Monitoring

## 🧩 Project Description
The Waste Thermo Energy Reactor is a low-cost, eco-friendly, and scalable solution that converts waste heat into electrical energy using thermoelectric generator (TEG) modules. Integrated with AI/ML capabilities, it allows real-time monitoring and performance prediction.

## ⚙️ Key Features
- Thermoelectric power generation from waste combustion
- AI/ML integration for predictive analytics and optimization
- Battery storage system with charge controller
- Modular hardware design
- Eco-conscious, portable, and scalable solution
